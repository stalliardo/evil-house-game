-  Fix the function so that i can select the required sprites better
- flip the image if the chacter is walking let / right
- add the idle image for when no button pressed

/////////////////////////////////////////////////// interaction logic ///////////////////////////////////////////////////

- close the interaction diplay when a chacacter moves out of the zone - DONE
- handle interaction options
    - need a read function
    - need a take item(to inventory) function
    - When a user has added something to the inventory there is no live record of this so going back to the prompt displayes the same message ie take the "paper clip" - DONE
    = Remove the buttons on add
    - also once the item has been taken the button either needs to be disabled or hidden or the item is continously added to the localstorage
