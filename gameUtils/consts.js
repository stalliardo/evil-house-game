        body: "You find yourself trapped in the dark and eerie basement of a sprawling haunted mansion. As you slowly regain consciousness, you realize that a deadly zombie outbreak has taken over the mansion and the surrounding grounds. The once-grand estate has turned into a nightmarish maze of undead horrors.\n\nYour heart races as you hear the distant moans of the undead echoing through the mansion's decaying walls. Panic sets in as you realize that your only chance of survival is to find a way out of this labyrinth of doom.\n\nIn the dim light of the basement, you notice a small table with various items scattered about. Among the debris, you spot a paper clip that might come in handy. Search for other items that could aid your escape and carefully explore your surroundings. Be cautious, as danger lurks around every corner.\n\nThe basement is merely the starting point of your treacherous journey. You must ascend through the haunted mansion's floors, each filled with its own horrors and challenges. The path to freedom won't be easy, and you must stay alert to survive. Use your wits, solve puzzles, and uncover secrets that may lead you to the key that unlocks the mansion's front doors.\n\nRemember, time is of the essence. The undead are relentless, and every moment you spend here puts your life at risk. Gather your courage, and may luck be on your side as you embark on your quest to escape the haunted mansion and survive the Zombie Outbreak.\n\nGood luck, brave survivor!",
